# Title: Status Dashboard API Rework

Status: Proposed

Context:

The current status dashboard API is experiencing performance and scalability issues, primarily due to:

- Scaling challenges: The API struggles to handle increasing traffic, resulting in slow response times and timeouts.
- Session management inefficiencies: Current session management mechanisms are not optimized, leading to performance bottlenecks and potential security risks.
- Database query inefficiencies: The underlying database schema is not optimized for the API's data access patterns, resulting in slow query execution.

These issues negatively impact the overall user experience of the status dashboard.

Considered Options:

- Option A: Optimize the current Flask application.
  - Pros: Lower development effort, potential for performance gains through optimization.
  - Cons: Limited scalability potential, might not fully address underlying issues.

- Option B: Complete rework using Golang and Gin framework.
  - Pros: High performance potential, strong concurrency support, large community, interesting task
  - Cons: Significant development effort, steep learning curve for team members.

- Option C: Rework using Python and FastAPI framework.
  - Pros: Leveraging existing Python skills, high performance, modern framework.
  - Cons: Potential performance limitations compared to Golang, might not fully address scaling challenges.

Decision Criteria:

- Performance benchmarks (response time, throughput)
- Scalability (ability to handle increased load)
- Development effort and time
- Team expertise and preferences
- Long-term maintainability

Consequences:

The chosen option will impact:

- API performance and responsiveness
- System scalability
- Development costs and timelines
- Team morale and productivity

Next Steps:

- Conduct performance benchmarks for the current Flask application.
- Evaluate the team's proficiency in Golang and FastAPI.
